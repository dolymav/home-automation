# Smart Home Sequential Circuit Blocks

This repository contains modular HDL designs for implementing a smart home system. Each feature is designed as a sequential circuit, with components integrated through a central controller for seamless operation. The system supports a variety of smart home functionalities, including automation, security, and AI-driven enhancements.

## Features

### Main Systems
1. **Home Automation System (home_automation_sys)**: Coordinates all smart devices, handling automation tasks for seamless integration.
2. **Reverse Home Automation (home_automation_reverse)**: Handles reverse functionality for system resets, overrides, and manual control.

### Lighting and Environment Control
3. **Smart Lights**: Use smart switches to control lights remotely.
4. **Motion Sensing**: Lights automatically turn on/off based on movement in rooms or corridors.
5. **Smart Thermostat**: Automates heating and cooling systems, adjusting temperature based on time of day or weather forecasts.
6. **Air Quality Monitoring**: Automatically controls air purifiers or humidifiers based on air quality readings.
7. **Window Blinds Automation**: Adjusts blinds or shades remotely using smart motors.

### Security and Surveillance
8. **Smart Cameras**: Integrates surveillance cameras with motion detection and remote monitoring capabilities.
9. **Door Locks**: Allows keyless entry, remote locking/unlocking, and temporary access codes for guests.
10. **Sensors**: Monitors doors/windows and sends alerts when theyâ€™re opened.
11. **Security Alerts**: Provides automated alerts via mobile app, email, or SMS for intrusions or security breaches.

### Smart Assistants and Appliances
12. **Smart Speakers**: Controls lights, appliances, and other devices through voice assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.
13. **Smart Appliances**: Integrates devices such as refrigerators, ovens, coffee makers, washing machines, and dishwashers into the system.
14. **Robot Vacuums**: Schedules robot vacuums to clean your floors at specific times.
15. **Automated Pet Feeders**: Programs pet feeders to dispense food at scheduled intervals.
