## Features

### Lighting and Environment Control
1. **Smart Lights**: Use smart switches to control lights remotely.
2. **Motion Sensing**: Lights automatically turn on/off based on movement in rooms or corridors.
3. **Smart Thermostat**: Automates heating and cooling systems, adjusting temperature based on time of day or weather forecasts.
4. **Air Quality Monitoring**: Automatically controls air purifiers or humidifiers based on air quality readings.
5. **Window Blinds Automation**: Adjusts blinds or shades remotely using smart motors.

### Security and Surveillance
6. **Smart Cameras**: Integrates surveillance cameras with motion detection and remote monitoring capabilities.
7. **Door Locks**: Allows keyless entry, remote locking/unlocking, and temporary access codes for guests.
8. **Sensors**: Monitors doors/windows and sends alerts when theyâ€™re opened.
9. **Security Alerts**: Provides automated alerts via mobile app, email, or SMS for intrusions or security breaches.

### Smart Assistants and Appliances
10. **Smart Speakers**: Controls lights, appliances, and other devices through voice assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.
11. **Smart Appliances**: Integrates devices such as refrigerators, ovens, coffee makers, washing machines, and dishwashers into the system.
12. **Robot Vacuums**: Schedules robot vacuums to clean your floors at specific times.
13. **Automated Pet Feeders**: Programs pet feeders to dispense food at scheduled intervals.

### Advanced Integrations
14. **App Control**: Centralizes control of all devices through a mobile app or smart home hub.
15. **AI & Machine Learning**: Integrates AI to learn routines and habits, making the system more intuitive and predictive.
16. **Home Robot Assistants**: Supports robots for tasks like cleaning, delivery, or social interaction.
17. **Security & Privacy Enhancements**: Includes facial recognition or voice verification for highly secure areas of the home.
